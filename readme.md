# GHOSTS Cyber Range & Exercise Simulation Tools

This repository contains tools to build and execute realistic cyber ranges for training, exercise, and simulation.

## Hauntbeats

Hauntbeats is a tool to generate realistic network beacon traffic for use in cyber ranges. Software that exhibits beaconing activity on a network can indicate the presence of an adversary on a network. Hauntbeats generates traffic on a specific timeline—every n minutes—that exercising teams can use to train against detecting and identifying beaconing activity over different timespans.
