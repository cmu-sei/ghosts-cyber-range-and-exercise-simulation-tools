# BEAM (Beacon Execution and Management)
BEAM is a tool to generate realistic network beacon traffic for use in cyber ranges. Software that exhibits beaconing activity on a network can indicate the presence of an adversary on a network. BEAM generates traffic on a specific timeline—every n minutes—that exercising teams can use to train against detecting and identifying beaconing activity over different timespans.
